# js-map-generator

An online tool to generate a custom map with custom rules with an osm dataset in a static website.

## todo

### style

- add favicon

- write a "how to use" in readme and add images

- add good and nice looking example (with links?)

- some images for dataIsBeatiful?

### bug

- little shaking on redraw and pan != [0,0]

### feature

- query e=exampleNumber; link to some predefined examples

### testing

- bigger maps and draw only some stuff on a bigger area, too slow?

### other

- code clean up and making everything maintainable

- make code more efficieant, look how often which function is called and maybe if there are bugs calling funcitions to often.
