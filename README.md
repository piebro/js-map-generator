# js-map-generator

An online tool to generate a custom map with custom rules with an osm dataset in a static website.

## todo

add favicon

save map file name in settings and check for it locally otherwise pop up and ask for it. Maybe with link to geo-fabrik?

How do I want to implement it? "file" and "osm-url" in map settings is confusing, because thats not how you change it. You should just change it with the button.

"file" and "osm-url" should be in the url though so you can share the link with the map and get prompted to open the fitting file.

get the zoom level of the link right with the zoom level of my map
